# Case-Based-Menu-Recommendation-System
This project implements a Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) system in Python to recommend personalized menus for events. The system retrieves similar past cases, adapts menus to user constraints (preferences, allergies, style, season), validates coherence, and learns from user feedback through the full CBR cycle.
